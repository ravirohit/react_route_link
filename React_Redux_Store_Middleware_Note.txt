Note:
Note on Object.assign. ex:
       Object.assign({}, state, {
         visibilityFilter: action.filter
       })
Object.assign() is a part of ES6, and is not supported by older browsers. To support them, you will need to either use a polyfill,
a Babel plugin, or a helper from another library like _.assign
--------------------------------------------------- Why Redux -----------------------------------------------
-> React: A JS library that helps us to divide up our app into multiple components
-> Redux: A complimentary library to React that provides a way to easily keep the data(State) and the events(Actions).

--------------------------------------------------- Redux Life Cycle -----------------------------------------
->  Redux architecture revolves around a strict unidirectional data flow(Desing pattern is called flux).
-> The data lifecycle in any Redux app follows these 4 steps:
Step-1:
    store.dispatch(action): An action is a plain object describing what happened. action is nothing but the current brief news with oject({type:'', payload:''})
	                        You can call store.dispatch(action) from anywhere in your app, including components and XHR callbacks, or even at scheduled intervals. 
Setp-2:
    The Redux store calls the reducer function you gave it. The store will pass two arguments to the reducer: the current state tree and the action.
	Note that a reducer is a pure function. It only computes the next state.
Step-3:
    The root reducer may combine the output of multiple reducers into a single state tree.
	meaning is: 
	let todoApp = combineReducers({
				   todos,             //is reducer
				   visibleTodoFilter  // is reducer
				 })
    will return something like:
	When you emit an action, todoApp returned by combineReducers will call both reducers like:
	  let nextTodos = todos(state.todos, action)
      let nextVisibleTodoFilter = visibleTodoFilter(state.visibleTodoFilter, action)
    It will then combine both sets of results into a single state tree:
	  return {
	    todos: nextTodos,
		visibleTodoFilter: nextVisibleTodoFilter
	  }
Step-4:
    The Redux store saves the complete state tree returned by the root reducer.
    This new tree is now the next state of your app! Every listener registered with store.subscribe(listener) will now be invoked; 
    listeners may call store.getState() to get the current state.
-------------------------------------------------------- Actions -------------------------------------------
-> Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. 
-> You send them to the store using store.dispatch().
Like: 
    {
	  type: ADD_TODO,
	  text: 'Build my first Redux app'
    }
-------------------------------------------------------- Reducers --------------------------------------------------------
-> Actions describe the fact that something happened, but don't specify how the application's state changes in response. This is the job of reducers
-> Given the same arguments, it should calculate the next state and return it. No surprises. No side effects. No API calls. No mutations. Just a calculation.
-> Note:
---> We don't mutate the state:
     We create a copy with Object.assign(). Object.assign(state, { visibilityFilter: action.filter }) is also wrong: it will mutate the first argument. 
	 You must supply an empty object as the first parameter. You can also enable the object spread operator proposal to write { ...state, ...newState } instead
---> We return the previous state in the default case. It's important to return the previous state for any unknown action.
--------------------------------------------------------- Store -------------------------------------------------------------
-> The Store is the object that brings them together. The store has the following responsibilities:
   a) Holds application state;
   b) Allows access to state via getState();
   c) Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action);
   d) Registers listeners via subscribe(listener);
   e) Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener).
-> It's important to note that you'll only have a single store in a Redux application.

----------------------------------------------------------- React Redux Integration ---------------------------------------------------------------	
-> Connecting React Components to Redux	: Connecting a React component to Redux allows the component to use the top-level store without having to pass 
the store down as a prop through  its parent components.
-> To start connecting components, we have to wrap our root component in Provider, a special React Redux component, and pass it the store variable.
						ReactDOM.render(
						  <Provider store={store}>
							<CommentBox />
						  </Provider>,
						  document.getElementById('content')
						);
-> Now Store is available to all the react component but it doesnt mean, Store is connected to all the component. If we want to connect the require 
component to the store to make it accessible, we have to use followng Steps in the component:

First, mapping state to props:
	const stateToprops=(state)=>{      // we can access the 'user' in our component using this.props.user. this is particulary for the read operation from store.
	  return {
		user:state.userReducer
	  }
	}
	const dispatchToProps=(dispatch)=>{  // we can access the 'register' in our component using this.props.register and emit the event to update/write state in store.
	  return{
		register:(thisRef)=>{
		  console.log("fun called:",thisRef.refs.name.value, ' thisRef.props:',thisRef.props);
		  thisRef.props.user.push(thisRef.refs.name.value);
		  dispatch({
			type:'NEW_USER_REG',
			payload: thisRef.props.user
		  });
		  thisRef.refs.name.value = '';
		}
	  }
	}
export default connect(stateToprops,dispatchToProps)(Homepage);    //connecting the Homepage Component to the Store

Note: whenever we update the store, the connected component's componentWillReceiveProps() method get called and their we can use setState() to re-render() comp.
